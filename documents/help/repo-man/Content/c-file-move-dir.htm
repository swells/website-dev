        <h1>Moving Files</h1>
        <p>You can move the files under <span class="screen">My Files</span> for which you are the <i>sole owner</i> from one user directory to another. If there are multiple users on a file, it cannot be moved.</p>
        <p>If you move a file into a directory in which a file by the same name already exists, then the <i><a href="d-file-versions.htm">Latest version</a></i> of the moved file becomes the <i>Latest</i> version of the file in the destination directory and the file histories are merged. For example, let's say you own two files of the same name in different directories (directory X and directory Y). You decide to move the file from directory X to directory Y, but directory Y already has a file by that same name. In that case, the contents and file properties (access rights, keyword, description) of the <i>Latest version</i> of the file from directory X become the new Latest version  of the file by the same name in directory Y. If you want to see the contents of the file in directory Y before the move, you would now need to look in the <a href="d-file-versions.htm">version history</a> to find it. In this case, all of the history for the file that was originally in directory X is also kept in the history of the file in directory Y. </p>
        <p><b>Important!</b> You cannot change the directory of files you co-own with other users. Files for which you are the sole owner can be moved to another directory; however, files owned by multiple users must remain under the original directory for as long as there are multiple owners.</p>
        <p class="task_title">To move a file to another directory:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the <span class="screen">Files</span> tab, select the file in the table.The <span class="screen">Manage</span> dropdown menu appears. </li>
            <li value="2"> In the <span class="screen">Manage</span> dropdown menu,  choose <span class="screen">Move</span>. The <span class="screen">Move File</span> dialog appears.</li>
            <li value="3">In the dialog, select the user directory into which you want to move the file(s). If you are not the sole owner, then you cannot move the file.</li>
            <li value="4">Click <span class="screen">Move</span>. The dialog closes and the file is moved.</li>
        </ol>
