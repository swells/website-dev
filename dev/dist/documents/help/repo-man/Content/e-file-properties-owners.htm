        <h1>Adding and Removing Owners</h1>
        <p>If you are an owner of a file, you can add additional owners to <i>support collaboration</i> during the file's development. </p>
        <p>Granting ownership does more than just allow a user to view or download a file, or even to execute a script; it also allows the user to edit the file, grant others ownership or revoke those rights, and even delete the file. For example, you might want add someone else as an owner so they can provide feedback on your script. &#160;Or, as another example, you might grant ownership of an R script or any other file to permit development to continue while you are away on vacation.</p>
        <p>If your objective is to permit other users and/or applications to see files and/or execute scripts, we recommend setting the appropriate <a href="e-file-properties.htm#AccessRights">access rights</a> using the <span class="screen">Restricted</span>, <span class="screen">Shared</span> or <span class="screen">Public</span> access rights as a means of controlling that access.</p>
        <p><span class="Note">Note:&#160;</span>Owners are also referred to as authors on API&#160;calls. </p>
        <p><b>Important!</b>&#160;In general, we do not recommend having multiple owners for a script, when it is in production, since calling applications are required to reference scripts using the file name, its directory, and its owner (author).  </p>
        <p class="task_title">To add or remove owners:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><a href="c-file-open.htm">Open</a> the <i>Latest</i> version of a file you own.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <span class="screen">File Properties</span> page, click <span class="screen">Add/Remove</span>. To learn more about other properties, <a href="e-file-properties.htm">read here</a>.</li>
            <li value="3">In the <span class="screen">Add/Remove Owners</span> dialog, edit the list of owners as appropriate.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li value="1">To add owners, type the username(s) to which you want to grant ownership into the field. <b>Important!</b> If you attempt to add an owner that already has a file by the same name in the same directory, then you will not be permitted to add that owner.</li></ul><ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li value="1">To remove owners from a file,  click the <span class="screen">x</span> next to the name. The name disappears from the list of owners. If that user was an owner before you started this task, the file will no longer be in any of his or her directories under <span class="screen">My Files</span>.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="4">Once the list reflect the owners who should be able to collaborate on this file, click <span class="screen">OK</span>. The dialog closes.</li>
        </ol>
