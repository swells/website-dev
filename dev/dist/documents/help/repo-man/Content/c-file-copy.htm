        <h1>Copying Files</h1>
        <p>You can make a copy of any file you own. When you copy a file, whether it is the <i><a href="d-file-versions.htm">Latest</a></i> version or previous version, a new file is created in the specified user directory in the repository. You can then see that file in the <span class="screen">Files</span> tab. The contents of your new file is a duplicate of the contents of the version of the file you copied. Your new file will have the same file properties as the version of the file being copied except you will be its sole owner. And, since this is a new file, the file will not have any previous versions.</p>
        <p>If you copy a file into a directory in which a file by the same name already exists, then a copy of the <i>Latest</i> version of the selected file becomes the <i>Latest</i> version of the file in the destination directory.  For example, let's say you own two files of the same name in different directories (directory X and directory Y). You decide to copy the file from directory X and save it in directory Y, but directory Y already has a file by that same name. In that case, the contents and file properties (access rights, keyword, description) of the <i>Latest</i> version of the file from directory X become the new <i>Latest</i> version  of the file by the same name in directory Y. The file is directory X remains unchanged. If you want to see the contents of the file in directory Y before the move, you would now need to look in the <a href="d-file-versions.htm">version history</a> to find it. In this case, all of the history for the file that was originally in directory X is also kept in the history of the file in directory Y. </p>
        <p class="task_title">To copy a file:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1"><a href="c-file-open.htm">Open</a> the file in the <span class="MyVariablesrepo">Repository Manager</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">In the <span class="screen">File Properties</span> page, choose <span class="screen">Copy</span> from the <span class="screen">File</span> menu.&#160;The <span class="screen">Copy File</span> dialog opens.</li>
            <li value="3">Enter a name for the file in the <span class="screen">Name</span> field. If a file by that name already exists, this will become the new <i>Latest</i> version of that file.</li>
            <li value="4">Select a directory in the repository in which the file should be stored from the <span class="screen">Directory</span> drop down list.</li>
            <li value="5">Click <span class="screen">Copy</span> to make the copy. The dialog closes and the <span class="screen">Files</span> tab appears on the screen.</li>
